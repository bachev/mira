1. What's new?
==============

For a complete list of changes since a specific version, please consult
CHANGES.txt, or for older updates, src/mira/CHANGES_old.txt of the source
package distributions.

Current stable versions will have major.minor.sub-version of 4.0.x while
development version will have a branch identifier of 4.9.x.


2. What's provided?
===================

You have downloaded the binary package of MIRA. It consists of binaries,
documentation and support files.

Binaries provided:
 - mira: for assembly or mapping of sequences
 - miramem: estimating memory needed to assemble projects. Realised through
   link to the mira binary.
 - miraconvert: for converting sequencing related file types into other
   types. Includes various options for processing, filtering etc.pp. Realised
   through link to the mira binary.
 - mirabait: quickly bait sequences from a large set. Realised through link to
   the mira binary.
Note: the above is just only one binary ("mira"), the others are just soft
links pointing to mira.

Database provided:
An excerpt of the RFAM rRNA database for finding rRNA or rDNA sequences.


Documentation provided:
See section 4 "Documentation"

Support files provided:
The support directory contains files for the Staden gap4/gap5 assembly viewer
and finishing tool which teaches the viewer about the tags MIRA uses. These
files are up-to-date and ready to use. The same files for "consed" should be
seen as "pointer to how things could be done" as I do not own consed to test
these files.


3. Installation
===============

The binaries (in directory "bin") are statically linked and self
contained, they should work with any Linux kernel >=2.6. On Mac OSX, they
may work on version 10.5 and should work on all versions >= 10.6.

Copy the the distributed package somewhere to your disk (either to one of the
"standard" places or somewhere in your home directory) and then soft link the
binaries into a directory which is in your shell PATH. Use "hash -r" or
"rehash" to have the shell know about the binaries.

Then: there is a directory "dbdata" in the MIRA package. Change to that
directory and run
  ./mira-install-sls-rrna.sh rfam_rrna-21-12.sls.gz

This will take a minute or so. Now you're done for MIRA.

Support files for the Staden GAP4 (GAP5) assembly finishing tool and consed
are in the "support" directory. Please refer to the documentation of the
respective package on how to integrate them into your environment.


4. Documentation
================

Small man pages can be found in the "man" directory. Copy this any place in
your system wher man will find them.

More extensive documentation in HTML and PDF format can be found in the 'docs'
directory.

Provided files:
 - DefinitiveGuideToMIRA.html
   Full documentation in HTML format
 - DefinitiveGuideToMIRA.pdf
   Full documentation in PDF format

If you are new to MIRA, I suggest you start reading the following chapters in
the full documentation:

 - Introduction (always)
 - Installation (eventually)
 - Preparing data
 - Then
    - De-novo assemblies
    - Mapping assemblies
    - EST / RNASeq assemblies
 - Working with the results of MIRA (always)
 - Utilities in the MIRA package (eventually)
 - Assembly of hard genome or EST projects (always)
 - Some advice when going into a sequencing project (eventually)

But it wouldn't hurt if you quickly looked at the table of content of all the
other chapters to determine whether there might be something interesting for
you in it.


5. Demos
========

At the moment no demos are provided. However, the step by step documentation
and example configuration in the manual should get you going in no time.

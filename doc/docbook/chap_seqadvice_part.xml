      Talk to your sequencing provider(s) before sequencing

    <para>
      Well, duh! But it's interesting what kind of mails I sometimes get. Like in:
    </para>
    <blockquote><quote>We've sequenced a one gigabase, diploid eukaryote with
    Solexa 36bp paired-end with 200bp insert size at 25x coverage. Could you

    genome?</quote>

    <para>
      A situation like the above should have never happened. Good sequencing
      providers are interested in keeping customers long term and will
      therefore try to find out what exactly your needs are. These folks
      generally know their stuff (they're making a living out of it) and most
      of the time propose you a strategy that fulfills your needs for a near
      minimum amount of money.
    </para>
    <para>
      Listen to them.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you think they try to rip you off or are overselling their
      competences (which most providers I know won't even think of trying,
      but there are some), ask a quote from a couple of other
      providers. You'll see pretty quickly if there are some things not being
      right.
    </para>
    <note>
      As a matter of fact, a rule which has saved me time and again for
      finding sequencing providers is not to go for the cheapest provider,
      especially if their price is far below quotes from other
      providers. They're cutting corners somewhere others don't cut for a
      reason.

      Choosing a sequencing provider

      This is a slightly reworked version of a post I made on the MIRA talk
      mailing list.  The question <emphasis>"Could you please recommend me a
      sequencing provider?"</emphasis> arrives every now and then in my
      private inbox, often enough for me decide to make a collage of the
      responses I gave in the past and post it to MIRA talk.

    <para>
      This response got, errrr, a little longer, but allow me to note that I
      will not give you names. The reasons are manyfold:

      <listitem>
	the company I am currently employed with is not in the sequencing
	provider business, but the company uses more than one sequencing
	provider on a regular base and I get to see quite some data

      <listitem>
	due to my development on MIRA in my free time, I'm getting insight
	into a number of highs and lows of sequencing technologies at
	different sequencing providers which I would not get if I were to
	expose them publicly ... I do not want to jeopardise these
	relationships.
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
      That being said, there are a number of general considerations which
      could help you. Excuse me in case the detours I am going to make are
      obvious to you, but I'm writing this also for future references. Also,
      please bear with me if I look at "sequencing" a bit differently than you
      might be accustomed to from academia, but I have worked for quite some
      time now in industry ... and there cost-effectiveness respectively
      "probability of success" of a project as whole is paramount to
      everything else. I'll come back to that further down.

      There's one -- and only one -- question which you, as sequencing
      customer, need to be able to answer ... if necessary in every

	  Detour - Sequencing -
	</title>
	<para>
	  For me, every "sequencing project", be it genomic or transcriptomic,
	  really consists of four major phases:
	</para>
	<orderedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      <emphasis role="bold">data generation:</emphasis> This can be
	      broadly seen as everything to get the DNA/RNA ready to be sent
	      off to sequencing (usually something the client does), the
	      library prep at the sequencing provider and finally the
	      sequencing itself (including base calling). An area of thousand
	      pitfalls where each step (and the communication) is crucial and
	      even one slight inadvertence can make the difference between a
	      "simple" project and a "hard" project. E.g.: taking DNA from
	      growing cells (especially bacteria in exponential growing phase)
	      might not be a good idea ... it makes assembly more
	      difficult. Some DNA extraction methods generate more junk than
	      good fragments etc.pp
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      The reason I am emphasizing this is simple: nowadays, the
	      "sequencing" itself is not the most expensive part of a
	      sequencing project, the next two steps are (most of the time
	      anyway).
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      <emphasis role="bold">assembly &amp; finishing:</emphasis> Still
	      a hard problem. Even a "simple" bacterium can present weeks of
	      effort to get right if its riddled with phages, prophages,
	      transposon elements, genetically engineered repeats etc.pp. And
	      starting with eukaryotes the real fun starts: ploidy,
	      retrotransposons etc. make for an unbelievable genome plasticity
	      and almost always have their own surprises. I've seen "simple"
	      Saccharomyces cerevisiae - where biologist swore to high heaven
	      they were "close to the publicly sequenced strains" - being
	      *very* different from what they were expected to be, both on the
	      DNA level and the genome organisation level.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      Getting eukaryotes right "down to the last base" might cost
	      quite some money, especially when looping back to step 1 (data
	      generation) to tackle difficult areas.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      <emphasis role="bold">annotation:</emphasis> Something many
	      people forget: give the sequence a meaning. Here too, things can
	      get quite costly if done "right", i.e., with hand
	      curation. Especially on organism which are not part of the more
	      commonly sequenced species or are generally more complex.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      Annotation of a de-novo transcriptome assembly is also not for
	      the faint of heart, especially if done on short, unpaired read
	      assemblies.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <emphasis role="bold">using the sequencing data:</emphasis>
	    ... for whatever it was generated for.

      <para>
	The above makes it clear that, depending on what you are really
	interested in within your project and what you expect to be able to do
	with the sequencing data, one can cut corners and reduce cost here and
	there (but not everywhere). And therefore, the above question "What do
	you want?" is one which - after the initial chit-chat of "hi, hello,
	nice to meet you, a pleasure to be here, etc." - every good
	representative of respectable sequencing providers I have met so far
	will ask as very first question. Usually in the form of "what do you
	want to sequence and what will you want to use the data for (and what
	not)?"

      </para>
      <para>
	Every other question - like where to sequence, which sequencing
	technology to use, how to process the sequencing data afterwards - is
	incidental and subordinated to your answer(s) to the question of "what
	do you want?!" But often sequencing customers get their priorities
	wrong by putting forward another question:

      <title>

      <sidebar>
	<title>
	  Detour - Putting things into perspective -
	</title>
	<para>
	  Come to think of it, people sometimes have very interesting ideas
	  regarding costs. Interesting as in "outright silly." It may be
	  because they do not really know what they want or feel unsure on a
	  terrain unbeknownst to them, and often instead focus their energy on
	  single aspects of a wider project because they feel more at home
	  there. And suddenly the focus lies on haggling and bartering for
	  some prices because, after all, this is something everyone knows how
	  to do, right?
	</para>
	<para>
	  As I hinted earlier, the pure sequencing costs are nowadays probably
	  not the biggest factor in any sequencing project: 454, Illumina,
	  IonTorrent and other technology providers have seen to that. E.g.,
	  in 2003/2004 it still cost somewhere between 150 - 200 kâ‚¬ to get an
	  8x Sanger coverage of a moderately sized bacterium (4 to 5
	  mb). Nowadays, for the same organism, you get coverages in the
	  hundreds (PacBio) or even thousands (going with Illumina) for a few
	  hundred Euro.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Cost for assembly, finishing and annotation have not followed the
	  same decrease. Yes, advances in algorithms have made things easier
	  in some parts, but not really on the same scale. Furthermore, the
	  "short read" technologies have more than made up for algorithmical
	  complexity when compared to the old Sanger reads. Maybe that
	  "(ultra)long read" technologies will alleviate the problem, but I
	  would not hold my breath for them to really work well.
	</para>
	<para>
	  One thing however has almost not changed at all: your costs of
	  actually doing followup experiments and data interpretation!
	  Remember that sequencing in itself is most of the time not the
	  ultimate goal, you actually want to gain something out of it. Be it
	  abstract knowledge for a paper or concrete hints for producing some
	  compounds or whatever, chances are that you will actually devote a
	  substantial amount of your resources (time, manpower, mental health)
	  into followup activities (lab experiments, genetic engineering,
	  writing papers) to turn the abstract act of sequencing into
	  something tangible, be it papers, fame, new products, money, or
	  whatever you want to achieve.
	</para>
	<para>
	  And this is the place where it pays to stop and think: "what do I
	  want? what are my strengths and where are my weaknesses? where are
	  my priorities?" The English have a nice saying: "Being penny-wise
	  and pound-foolish is not wise." I may add: Especially not if you are
	  basing man months / years of lab work and your career on the outcome
	  of something like sequencing. Maybe I'm spoiled because I have left
	  academia for quite some time now, but in sequencing I always prefer
	  to throw a bit more money at the sequencing process itself to
	  minimise risks of the later stages.

	WHERE TO SEQUENCE?
      </title>

	There's one last detour I'd like to make, and that is the question of "where to sequence?"
      </para>
      <sidebar>
	<title>
	  Detour - Public or private, old-timers or young-timers ? -
	</title>
	<para>
	  Choosing a sequencing provider is highly dependent on your answer to
	  "what do you want?" In case you want to keep the sequencing data (or
	  the very act of sequencing) secret (even only for some time) will
	  probably lead you to commercial sequencing companies. There you more
	  or less have complete control on the data. Paranoid people might
	  perhaps argue that you can have that only with own sequencing
	  equipment and personnel, but I have the feeling that only a minority
	  is able to cough-up the necessary money for purchasing sequencing
	  equipment for a small one-time project.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Instead of companies you could however also look whether one of the
	  existing sequencing centers in the world might be a good cooperation
	  candidate. Especially if you are doing this project within the scope
	  of your university. Note however that there might be a number of
	  gotchas lurking there, beside the obvious "the data is not really
	  secret anymore": sometimes the raw sequencing data needs to be
	  publicly released, maybe earlier than you would like; or the
	  sequencing center imposes that each and every paper you publish with
	  that data as basis has them as (co-)first author.
	</para>
	<para>
	  A related problem is "whom do I trust to deliver good work?"
	  Intuition says that institutes with a long sequencing history have
	  amassed quite some knowledge in this field, making them experts in
	  all three aspects (data generation, assembly &amp; finishing,
	  annotation) of a sequencing project ... and intuition probably isn't
	  wrong there. The same thing is probably true for sequencing
	  companies which have existed for more than just a couple of years,
	  though from what I have seen so far is that - due to size -
	  sequencing companies sometimes really focus on the data generation
	  and rely on partner companies for "assembly" and "annotation". This
	  is not to say that younger companies are bad. Incidentally, it is my
	  belief that in this field, people are still more important than
	  technology ... and every once in a while good people split off a
	  well known institute (or company) to try their luck in an own
	  company. Always look for references there.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The following statement is a personal opinion (and you can call me
	  biased for that): Personally, I am however quite wary of sequencing
	  done at locations where a sequencer exists because someone got a
	  grant to buy one (because it was chic &amp; en-vogue to get a shiny
	  new toy) but where the instrument then slowly starts to collect dust
	  after the initial flurry ... and because people often do not
	  calculate chemistry costs which arise in case they'd really thought
	  of using the machine 24/7. I want to know that technicians actually
	  work with those things every day, that they know the ins and outs of
	  the work, the protocols, the chemistry, the moods of the machine
	  (even an instrument can have a bad day). I honestly do not believe
	  that one can build up enough expertise when operating these things
	  "every once in a while".

	Summary of all the above
      </title>
      <para>
	All of the above means that depending on what I need the data for, I
	have the freedom choose among different providers. In case I just need
	masses of raw data and potential savings are substantial, I might go
	with the cheapest whom I know to generate good data. If I want good
	service and second round of data in case I am not 110% satisfied with
	the first round (somehow people have stopped questioning me there),
	this is usually not the cheapest provider ... but the additional costs
	are not really high. If I wanted my data really really quick, I'd
	search for a provider with Ion Torrent, or MiSeq (I am actually
	looking for one with a MiSeq, so if anyone knows a good one,
	preferably in Europe -> mail me). Though I already did transcriptomics
	on eukaryotes, in case I needed larger eukaryotes assembled de-novo
	&amp; also annotated, I would probably look for the help of a larger
	sequencing center as this starts to get dangerously near the fringe of
	my field of expertise.
      </para>
      <para>
	In closing this part, here are a couple of guidelines which have not
	failed me so far for choosing sequencing providers:
      </para>
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  Building a good relationship helps. In case your institute /
	  university already has good (or OK) experience with a provider, ask
	  there first.
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  It is a lot easier to build a good relationship with someone who
	  speaks your language ... or a good(!) English.
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  I will not haggle for a couple of hundred Euros in a single project,
	  I'll certainly reconsider this when savings are in the tens of
	  thousands.
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  Managing expectations: some sequencing projects are high risk from
	  the start, for lots of possible reasons (underfunded, bad starting
	  material, unclear organism). This is *sometimes* (!) OK as long as
	  everyone involved knows and acknowledges this. However, you should
	  always have a clear target ("what am I looking for?") and preferably
	  know in advance how to treat the data to get there.
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  Errors occur, stay friendly at first. In case the expectations were
	  clear (see above), the material and organism are not at fault but
	  the data quality somehow is bad, it is not too difficult to have the
	  sequencing provider acknowledge this and get additional sequencing
	  for no added cost.
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>
	Regarding the technologies you can use ... it really depends on what
	you want to do :-) And note that I base my answers on technologies
	available today without bigger problems: PacBio, Illumina, with
	IonTorrent as Joker for quick projects. Since 2018, 454 can be considered
	to be dead as the Newbler assembler is not availÃ¶able anymore and I am
	not even sure sequencing kits are manufactured. Oxford Nanopore has
	become a game changer with reads of several hundred Kb and even over a
	megabase, but still requires quite some tinkering both in protocols
	and on the bioinformatics side.

	  <para>
	    As of Fall 2018: aim for at least 100x coverage of raw data,
	    better 130x to 150x as pre-processing (quality clip, removal of
	    adapters and other sequencing artefacts) will take its toll and

	  On a cheap gene fishing expedition? Probably Illumina HiSeq, at
	  least 100bp, 150 to 250bp or 300bp if your provider supports it
	  well. Paired-end definitely a plus. As alternative: Ion Torrent for
	  small organism (maybe up to 100Mb) and when you need results quickly
	  without caring for possible frameshifts.

	  Want some larger contigs? PacBio. Add in cheap Illumina 100bp
	  paired-end (150 to 300bp if provider supports it) to get rid of
	  those last frameshifts which may remain.

      <para>
	There is a reason why Illumina currently dominates the market as it
	does: a cheap Illumina run (preferably paired-end) will answer most of
	your questions in 95% of the cases. Things will get difficult for
	organisms with high numbers of repeats and/or frequent genome
	re-arrangements. Then using longer read technologies and/or Illumina
	mate-pair may be required.

	Low coverage isn't worth it
      </title>
      <para>
	There's one thing to be said about coverage and de-novo assembly:
	especially for bacteria, getting more than 'decent' coverage is
	<emphasis>cheap</emphasis> with any current day technology. Every
	assembler I know will be happy to assemble de-novo genomes with
	coverages of 25x, 30x, 40x ... and the number of contigs will still
	drop dramatically between a 15x Ion Torrent and a 30x Ion Torrent
	project.
      </para>
      <para>
	In any case, do some calculations: if the coverage you expect to get
	reaches 50x (e.g. 200MB raw sequence for a 4MB genome), then you
	(respectively the assembler) can still throw away the worst 20% of the
	sequence (with lots of sequencing errors) and concentrate on the
	really, really good parts of the sequences to get you nice contigs.
      </para>
      <para>
	Other example: the price for 1 gigabase Illumina paired-end of a
	single DNA prep is way, way below USD 1000, even with commercial
	providers. Then you just need to do the math: is it worth to invest
	10, 20, 30 or more days of wet lab work, designing primers, doing PCR
	sequencing etc. and trying to close remaining gaps or hunt down
	sequencing errors when you went for a 'low' coverage or a non-hybrid
	sequencing strategy? Or do you invest a few bucks more to get some
	additional coverage and considerably reduce the uncertainties and gaps
	which remain?
      </para>
      <para>
	Remember, you probably want to do research on your bug and not
	research on how to best assemble and close genomes. So even if you put
	(PhD) students on the job, it's costing you time and money if you
	wanted to save money earlier in the sequencing. Penny-wise and
	pound-foolish is almost never a good strategy :-)
      </para>
      <para>
	I do agree that with eukaryotes, things start to get a bit more
	interesting from the financial point of view.

	Catch-22: too high coverage
      </title>
      <para>
	There is, however, a catch-22 situation with coverage: too much
	coverage isn't good either. Without going into details: sequencing
	errors sometimes interfere heavily when coverage exceeds ~60x to 80x
	for 454 &amp; IonTorrent and approximately 150x to 200x for
	Solexa/Illumina.
      </para>
      <para>
	In those cases, do yourself a favour: there's more than enough data
	for your project ... just cut it down to some reasonable amount: 40x
	to 50x for 454 &amp; IonTorrent, 100x for Solexa/Illumina.

      A word of caution regarding your DNA in hybrid sequencing projects
    </title>
    <para>
      So, you have decided that sequencing your bug with PacBio and Illumina
      (or PacBio and Ion Torrent or whatever) may be a viable way to get the
      best bang for your buck. Then please follow this advice: prepare enough
      DNA <emphasis>in</emphasis> <emphasis>one</emphasis>
      <emphasis>go</emphasis> for the sequencing provider so that they can
      sequence it with all the technologies you chose without you having to
      prepare another batch ... or even grow another culture!
    </para>
    <para>
      The reason for that is that as soon as you do that, the probability that
      there is a mutation somewhere that your first batch did not have is not
      negligible. And if there is a mutation, even if it is only one base,
      there is a >95% chance that MIRA will find it and thinks it is some
      repetitive sequence (like a duplicated gene with a mutation in it) and
      splits contigs at those places.
    </para>
    <para>
      Now, there are times when you cannot completely be sure that different
      sequencing runs did not use slightly different batches (or even strains).
    </para>
    <para>
      One example: the SFF files for SRA000156 and SRA001028 from the NCBI
      short trace archive should both contain E.coli K12 MG-16650 (two
      unpaired half plates and a paired-end plate). However, they contain
      DNA from different cultures. Furthermore, the DNA was prepared by
      different labs. The net effect is that the sequences in the paired-end
      library contain a few distinct mutations from the sequences in the two
      unpaired half-plates. Furthermore, the paired-end sequences contain
      sequences from phages that are not present in the unpaired sequences.
    </para>
    <para>
      In those cases, provide strain information to the reads so that MIRA can
      discern possible repeats from possible SNPs.

	Do not sample DNA from bacteria in exponential growth phase!
      </title>
      <para>
	The reason is simple: some bacteria grow so fast that they start
	replicating themselves even before having finished the first
	replication cycle. This leads to more DNA around the origin of
	replication being present in cells, which in turn fools assemblers and
	mappers into believing that those areas are either repeats or that
	there are copy number changes.

	For de-novo assemblies, MIRA will warn you if it detects data which
	points at exponential phase. In mapping assemblies, look at the
	coverage profile of your genome: if you see a smile shape (or V
	shape), you have a problem.

	Beware of (high copy number) plasmids!
      </title>
      <para>
	This is a source of interesting problems and furthermore gets people
	wondering why MIRA sometimes creates more contigs than other
	assemblers when it usually creates less.
      </para>
      <para>
	Here's the short story: there are data sets which include one ore
	several high-copy plasmid(s). Here's a particularly ugly example:
	SRA001028 from the NCBI short read archive which contains a plate of
	paired-end reads for Ecoli K12 MG1655-G
	(<ulink url="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/TraceDB/ShortRead/SRA001028/"/>).
      </para>
      <para>
	The genome is sequenced at ~10x coverage, but during the assembly,
	three intermediate contigs with ~2kb attain a silly maximum coverage
	of ~1800x each.  This means that there were ~540 copies of this
	plasmid (or these plasmids) in the sequencing.
      </para>
      <para>
	When using the uniform read distribution algorithm - which is switched
	on by default when using "--job=" and the quality level of 'accurate' -
	MIRA will find out about the average coverage of the genome to be at
	~10x.  Subsequently this leads MIRA to dutifully create ~500 additional
	contigs (plus a number of contig debris) with various incarnations of
	that plasmid at an average of ~10x, because it thought that these were
	repetitive sites within the genome that needed to be disentangled.
      </para>
      <para>
	Things get even more interesting when some of the plasmid / phage
	copies are slightly different from each other. These too will be split
	apart and when looking through the results later on and trying to join
	the copies back into one contig, one will see that this should not be
	done because there are real differences.
      </para>
      <para>
	DON'T PANIC!
      </para>
      <para>
	The only effect this has on your assembly is that the number of
	contigs goes up. This in turn leads to a number of questions in my
	mailbox why MIRA is sometimes producing more contigs than Newbler (or
	other assemblers), but that is another story (hint: Newbler either
	collapses repeats or leaves them completely out of the picture by not
	assembling repetitive reads).
      </para>
      <para>
	What you can do is the following:
      </para>
      <orderedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    either you assemble everything together and the join the plasmid
	    contigs manually after assembly, e.g. in gap4 (drawback: on really
	    high copy numbers, MIRA will work quite a bit longer ... and you
	    will have a lot of fun joining the contigs afterwards)
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    or, after you found out about the plasmid(s) and know the sequence,
	    you filter out reads in the input data which contain this sequence
	    (you can use <command>mirabait</command> for this) and assemble the
	    remaining reads.

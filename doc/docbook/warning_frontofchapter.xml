  The documentation of MIRA 3.9.x has not completely caught up yet with the changes introduced by MIRA now using manifest files. Quite a number of recipes still show the old command-line style, e.g.:
  </para>
  <screen>
mira --project=... --job=... ...</screen>
  <para>
    For those cases, please refer to chapter 3 (the reference) for how to write manifest files.

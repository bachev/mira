Install MIRA and documentation according to the section "Installation" in the
"Definitive Manual". Once that is done, read the chapter which takes care of
the sequencing technology you want to use. Follow the walk-throughs given
there as template for your own projects.

For viewing/editing assemblies, an assembly editor is recommended. Have a look
at GAP4 (from the Staden package, see
http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/staden/), MIRA generates output suited for
import into gap4 (by using caf2gap)

James Bonfield released a working version of gap5. Import into gap5 is done
with SAM or CAF files and the "tg_index" tool supplied in the gap5 package.

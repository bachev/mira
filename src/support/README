Files in this directory are meant as help for supporting interaction
with other genomic software.

Currently, only a small definition file for defining tags in the
Staden package (GAP4) and the consed package are present, but this
section should grow.

Files included: 

For the STADEN package:

  GTAGDB   For the gap4 package, so that it knows the tags used by
	   mira, miraEST and EdIt


For the consed package

  consedrc.13.0 For the consed package 13.0 (or perhaps 12.0, I don't
		know). Put this line into your .consedrc and let it
		point to the consedtaglib.txt that you use

  consedtaglib.txt For the consed package 13.0 and up (or perhaps
		   12.0, I don't know). Add these lines to the file
		   you use as tag library.

rRNA database for MIRA
----------------------
This package contains data to enable MIRA and MIRABAIT to search for rRNA and
rDNA. This data set contains an excerpt of the RFAM database.

Installation
------------
First install MIRA >= 4.9.6.

Then do this (eventually you might need sudo rights, depending on where and
how the MIRA package was installed):

  mira-install-sls-rrna.sh rfam_rrna-21-12.sls.gz

Wait a minute or two, then you're done.

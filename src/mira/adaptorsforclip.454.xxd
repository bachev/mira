# This is not an entirely regular FASTA file
# Every name and every sequence must be on just one line
# Furthermore, comment lines are (obviously) allowed as they
#  will be stripped before processing with xxd, but restrain
#  from adding comments to FASTA names (e.g. ">s1 some comment")
#
# Note that if you want to have sequences searched in
# reverse complement direction, then the reverse complemented
# sequences must be included extra in this file (see "rev_*"
# down below

# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AC_PATH_GENERIC(LIBRARY [, MINIMUM-VERSION [, ACTION-IF-FOUND [, ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND]]])
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Runs a LIBRARY-config script and defines LIBRARY_CFLAGS and LIBRARY_LIBS
#
#   The script must support `--cflags' and `--libs' args. If MINIMUM-VERSION
#   is specified, the script must also support the `--version' arg. If the
#   `--with-library-[exec-]prefix' arguments to ./configure are given, it
#   must also support `--prefix' and `--exec-prefix'. (In other words, it
#   must be like gtk-config.)
#
#   For example:
#
#      AC_PATH_GENERIC(Foo, 1.0.0)
#
#   would run `foo-config --version' and check that it is at least 1.0.0
#
#   If so, the following would then be defined:
#
#      FOO_CFLAGS to `foo-config --cflags`
#      FOO_LIBS   to `foo-config --libs`
#
#   At present there is no support for additional "MODULES" (see
#   AM_PATH_GTK) (shamelessly stolen from gtk.m4 and then hacked around a
#   fair amount)

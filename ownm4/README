Synopsis
--------

 The `Autoconf Macro Archive <http://autoconf-archive.cryp.to/>`_
 aims to provide a collection of reusable Autoconf_ macros as
 free software. The archive currently features more than 300
 macros which perform portability tests ranging from compiler
 support for weird language extensions to automatic generation of
 sophisticated Automake_ rules. All these macros have been
 contributed by friendly supporters of the cause from all over
 the Internet; this archive is merely a distribution of other
 people's efforts.

How To Contribute
-----------------

 Have you written a macro and would like to share it? Great! Just
 write up a brief explanation how to use it, send it off to
 <simons@cryp.to>, and wait for me to get back to you with either
 an report of success or lots of questions.

 If you feel like being particularly helpful, you can do me the
 favor and format the macro in the archive's internal markup
 before submitting it::

  dnl @synopsis AX_MY_MACRO(param1 [, param1])
  dnl
  dnl Describe what test the macro performs,
  dnl what the parameters do, and how the
  dnl result of running the macro can be used.
  dnl
  dnl An empty "dnl" line separates paragraphs.
  dnl
  dnl   An indented line is a block quote,
  dnl   which is nice for distinguishing
  dnl   examples from other text.
  dnl
  dnl @author Joe Doe <joe@example.org>
  dnl @version 2006-10-15
  dnl @license AllPermissive

  AC_DEFUN([AX_MY_MACRO],[
  ...
  ])

 Please submit *one file per macro*. If you have a family of
 macros that depend on each other, denote that by calling
 ``AC_REQUIRE``; then ``aclocal(1)`` will collect all of them
 automatically no matter over how many files they are spread.

 The comprehensive list of all keywords understood by the
 formatting engine is:

 ``@category keyword``

     The keyword may be any of ``Automake``, ``C``,
     ``CrossCompilation``, ``Cxx``, ``Fortran``,
     ``InstalledPackages``, ``Java``, ``LaTeX``, or ``Misc``. You
     can assign a macro into more than one category by specifying
     multiple ``@category`` lines::

      dnl @category C
      dnl @category Cxx

 ``@synopsis a line of free text``

     The synopsis line should provide the usual specification of
     the macro's arguments. If you think it's useful, you can
     provide more than one ``@synopsis``.

 ``@summary a line of free text``

     Give a one-sentence explanation of what the macro does. This
     short summary will be displayed on the generated index
     pages.

 ``@version yyyy-mm-dd``

     Every macro in the archive is versioned with the date of the
     its last modification. For most macros, that is the day of
     submission.

 ``@author My Name <my.address@example.net>``

     This tag accepts free text, actually, so you can write
     whatever you want, but it's good practice to use the common
     format shown above. Multiple ``@author`` lines are
     permitted.

 ``@license keyword``

     The keyword may be any of ``AllPermissive``, ``GPL2``,
     ``GPLWithACException``, or ``BSD``. The Free Software
     Foundation recommends_ the all-permissive license for
     Autoconf macros.
